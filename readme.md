This is the project repo for the JPMC Software Engineering Lite Program.

Created a RewardValue class, where it takes either cashValue(Double) or mileValue(Integer) as a constructor parameter.
The class has two methods, one for getting cashValue and other for getting mileValue

Modified the testcase file and solved two failed test cases.
